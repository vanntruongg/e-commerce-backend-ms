This project aims to learn about microservices architecture and implement it using Java

## Learning Objectives
- **Understand the principle of microservices architecture**:
    Gain a deep understanding of how microservices work 
    and the benefits of breaking down a system into independent, loosely-coupled services.
- **Implementing inter-service communication using both synchronous and asynchronous patterns**:
    Learn how service can communicate with each other efficiently using RESTful APIs, OpenFeign,
    and message broker like Kafka.
- **Managing data consistency and reliability across distributed system**:
    Explore strategies for maintaining data integrity and consistency across multiple services and database,
    ensuring system reliability even in distributed environments.



## Technologies and frameworks
- **Programming Language**: Java 17
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.3
- **Inter-Service Communication**: OpenFeign
- **Message Broker**: Kafka
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
